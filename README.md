# DaniUtils, or: some random stuff
This is a random collection of (ugly) utilities that I wrote for myself over the years.

This repository is going to be:
* updated at random times (if at all, I may just never upload anything besides the first commit if I know myself)
* containing terrible code, as most of these are hacks I needed for something, so I stopped working on them as long as they did  their job
* absolutely and positively unmantained and unsupported
* potentially harmful, upsetting or offensive

I'm only doing this to fiddle with github and to sync this junk across various machines. Seriously, I don't even know how you ended up on here, but feel free to take anything if it's handy. Don't tell me that everything's awful, I know that already.
Comments are meant exclusively for myself, so it's not my problem if they make no sense to anyone else. I've already gone too far with this readme anyway.
